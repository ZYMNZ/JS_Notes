## Operations

- The `**` operator.
  - mass / (height \* height) IS THE SAME AS => mass / (height \*\* 2).

## String Interpolation

```js
let fName = "conan";
let lName = "7x";

let fullName = `My name is ${fName} ${lName}`;
```

### String

Back ticks can be used to write normal strings.

In JS to write a string we can use `""` OR `''` OR ` ``(backtick) `

Using backticks:

- we dont need to use `/n`, we can write multiple lines with putting any sign for creating a new line.
